            <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3> 
            
            <h2>Sometimes, the gems are buried in the sand </h2>
            <p>The internet is full of new information - but there are also this classic, high-quality blogs that were published years ago (like this one: <a href="http://52weeksofux.com/" target="_blank">52 Weeks of UX</a>).<br>
            <br>    
            I wanted a service that helps me manage all these old blog feeds and remind me to read them on a regular basis. After all, new content doesn't always equal to better. <b>People still read "War and Peace" even though it was published in 1869. Why can't we be more vintage about blogs?</b></p>
            
<!--
            <h3>SCOPE</h3>
                <p><b>Time Frame: </b>10 days<br>
                    <b>My Role: </b>UI&UX designer + front-end developer
                </p>  
-->

            <div class="space15px"></div><br>
            <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3> 
<!--            <h2>Use design to showcase the researcher's work, engage users, and build credibility</h2>-->
                <p>I talked to a few people who are avid blog readers about this idea as a "speed-dating exercise". I immediately got confirmation that they would want to use this service. Upon more probing, I found that they have the following needs specifically: 
                </p>
                <ul class="text-list">
                    <li>They want to make sure they get a reasonable amount of content - they can only dedicate <b>a limited amount of time</b> to learning. </li>
                <li>They would use it for <b>career focused</b> blogs. </li>
                <li>This service is seen more as <b>a "learning" platform</b> rather than just to keep up with industry trends. </li>
                <li>They would prefer to use this service on <b>mobile</b> because they can read anytime</li>
                <li>They need a <b>good reading experience</b> (as good as other platforms such as Medium)</li>
            </ul>


            
            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <h3>DEFINING GOALS</h3>
                <h2>A balance between user goals and business goals</h2>
                <p>The vision I have for Replay is <b>to help people build professional skills through reading previously published but high-quality blog posts</b>. Some specific goals are:</p>
                     <ul class="text-list">
                         <li><b>User Goal: </b>help the user achieve their goal (career development)</li>
                   <li><b>Business Goal:</b> increase user engagement with the app </li>
                    <li><b>Business Goal: </b>encourage social sharing to spread brand awareness</li></ul>
                
        
            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
            <h2>Learning from other apps</h2>
                <p>I looked at 4 types of apps: blog platforms, education, and RSS feed and reading apps.</p>

                <p><b>Blog Apps</b></p>
                
                
                <p><b>Findings</b></p>
                <p>It makes sense to target users in the tech industry as a starting point, as there are a lot of resources in this industry and these blog platforms rooted in the tech industry have shown success.
                    <br></br>
                MyBridge has a very similar goal than my product idea. From reviews from its app store, users liked the unique "only 10 best articles a day" aspect of the app, compared with an endless feed of articles. <i>"It's not hard to find entertainment. It's very hard to find applications that don't throw me to the entertainment wolves."</i>   
                </p>

                <li>MyBridge liked the "only 10 articles a day" model.</li>
                <li>Progress tracking is a shared important aspect of all the education apps.</li>
                <li>All the reading apps have the following features: 1. favorite/save 2. categorization 3. Blog recommendations</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>PRODUCT DECISIONS</h3>
            <h2>Prioritizing the features</h2>
                <p>Based on user research and competitive analysis, I decided to include the following main features in the first version of the product</p>
                <ul class="text-list">
                <li>See the blog posts they can/should read today</li>
                <li>Favorite a blog post and see all of them in one place</li>
                <li>Progress bar for each blog</li>
                <li>See all blogs</li>
                </ul>

                <p>After a few iterations of low-to-mid fidelity prototypes, I created this high-fidelity one. You can check out the <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/Q4B4USN3C#/screens/226952592" target="_blank">InVision Prototype</a> here.
