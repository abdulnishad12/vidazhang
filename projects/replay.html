            <h2>Sometimes, the gems are buried in the sand </h2>
            <p>The internet is full of new information - but there are also this classic, high-quality blogs that were published years ago (like this one: <a href="http://52weeksofux.com/" target="_blank">52 Weeks of UX</a>).</p><br>

            <br>  
            <p>
              If you buy a book, you are probably goign to finish it. However, if bookmark a website, chances are, you will forget about it in a week. Self-motivating is hard. <b>How can I help people read previously published but high quality blogs?</b> </p>

            <h2>Use user research to guide the product direction</h2>
                <p>I talked to a few people who are avid blog readers about this idea as a "speed-dating exercise". I immediately got confirmation that they would want to use this service. Upon more probing, I found that they have the following needs specifically.

                <li>This service is seen more as <b>a "learning" platform</b> rather than just to keep up with industry trends. </li>
                <li>They would prefer to use this service on <b>mobile</b> because they can read anytime</li>

                <p>I looked at 4 types of apps: blog platforms, education, and RSS feed and reading apps.</p>

                <p>It makes sense to target users in the tech industry as a starting point, as there are a lot of resources in this industry and these blog platforms rooted in the tech industry have shown success.
                    <br></br>
                MyBridge has a very similar goal than my product idea. From reviews from its app store, users liked the unique "only 10 best articles a day" aspect of the app, compared with an endless feed of articles. <i>"It's not hard to find entertainment. It's very hard to find applications that don't throw me to the entertainment wolves."</i>   
                </p>

            <h3 id='s6' class='section'>DESIGN DECISIONS</h3>
            <h2>Use strategies to help users maximize their learning</h2>
            <p>There are two different ways to measure whether users are maximizing their learning experience in Replay: 1. Number of articles read intentionally; 2. Number of blogs sites that they finish reading. I used the following strategies to achieve these goals.  
          </p>
          <div class="project-img-div-long">
                        <img class="project-img-long" src="../assets/Replay/motivation.png" alt="Motivational design">
          </div>
          <br><br>
          <h2>Be mindful of human factors</h2>
          <p>This is a detail that I paid attention to during user testing. The original filter design allows more space to show blog titles, but when user wants to exit out of it, it's really hard to reach the "X" icon. In the next iteration, I reduced the height of the filter overlay to about half of the screen to make the experience more "human finger friendly".</p>

                        <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/Replay/Human-factor.png" alt="human factors">
          </div>
        <br><br>
          <h2>Creating an awesome reading experience through visual design</h2>
          <p>I decided to use Helvetica for all the typography in this app, because I want a typeface that everyone finds familiar and has great legibility. I also used different font weights, colors, and sizes to create a clear information hierarchy.</p>
          <div class="project-img-div-med">
                        <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/Replay/reading-exp.png" alt="reading experience">

            <h3 id='s7' class='section'>REFLECTIONS</h3>

                <p>This is an idea that I've always felt passionate about and I gave myself about 12 hours to work on. I had fun during the process. Three main lessons I learned from this project are: 
                </p>
          <ul class="text-list">
                <li>The sky is the limit, but with technical and time constraints, I learned to <b>prioritize features that provide most value to users</b>;</li>
                <li>Consider <b>human factors</b> to enhance the UX: the “fat finger” problem, Fitts’ Law;</li>
                <li><b>Visual design is a crucial part of the overall experience</b>, especially when the function of the app is heavily dependent on the information hierarchy and legibility of the content.</li>
                </ul>
