            <p>With the prevalence of sensor-based smart phone apps, mobile data privacy is getting more and more complex. 
            <br><br>
            This project is <b>a collaboration between CMU, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA" target="_blank">DARPA</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBN_Technologies" target="_blank">BBN</a>, and <a href="https://www.invincea.com/" target="_blank">Invincea</a></b>, with the aim to achieve an order of magnitude improvements for mobile privacy. As the designer on the team (advised by <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/jason-hong" target="_blank">Professor Jason Hong</a>), my role is to reimagine the UX and UI for privacy settings in a privacy-enhanced Android OS.
            </p>    
            <p>This project is still work-in-progress.

            <h3>PROJECT BACKGROUND</h3>    
            <h2>The new privacy policy data model</h2>
            <p>In current Android OS, apps tell you what permissions they are using (e.g. location, camera), but they don't tell you</p>
            <ul class="text-list">
                <li><b>Why they are using these permissions</b> (e.g. for advertising)</li>
                <li><b>Who they are sending their data to </b>(e.g. to third-party libraries like AdMob)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this project, we are building a future in which users can know all those information. 
            </p>  
                
            <div class="project-img-div-med">
                    <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/DARPA/data-model.png" alt="Data Model">
            </div>
            <h4>Our project shows user what the permissions are used for and who are the data being sent to</h4>
            <br>    
            
                <p>This is the new data model that DARPA and CMU will be proposing to Android: all Android developers need to specify the purpose of each privacy data use; on top of that, we can now parse out what third-party libraries are using what privacy data.<br><br>
                The ultimate goal is to incorporate this data model into Android OS and the UI I'm designing for will be in system settings. As of right now, we're developing it as a stand-alone app.</p> 
                
<!--
            Engineers have done the ground work. But now, here come the design challenges. For example:<p> 
                <ul class="text-list">
                    <li>How can we transfer all these data onto a ~2x4 inch mobile screen?</li> 
                    <li>How can we make sure privacy settings are easy to understand and manage?</li> 
                    <li><b>How can we best protect users' mobile privacy under this new paradigm? </b></li>
                </ul>
                
-->
                
            <div class="space15px"></div><br>
            <h3>FAIL FAST, ITERATE FAST</h3> 
                <p>Through an interactive design process, I was quickly moving between paper and digital <b>prototyping, testing </b>prototypes with users, and <b>co-creating</b> with and getting feedback from my advisor and engineers. From each iteration, I learned something valuable. Some helped me make small usability improvements, some helped me make major changes in my design direction.
            </p>
                <br>
            <h2>Initial iterations focused on flexible data organization</h2>
            <p>My early ideation evolved around solving this problem:</p>
                <ul class='text-list'>
                    <li><b>How can people manage all their multi-layer privacy settings most efficiently, given the new model?</b></li>
                </ul>
            
<!--
            <ul class='text-list'>
                <li>Which apps of mine use location data? (view by permission)</li>
                <li>Which apps of mine use my data for advertising? (view by purpose)</li>
                <li>What permission does this app request for and why?</li>
                <li>What are the unusual behaviors of my apps and what actions do I need to take?</li>
            </ul>
-->
                
                <p>To solve this problem, I focused my initial prototypes on flexible data organization so that users can quickly see and manage their privacy data in different views: by apps, permissions, purposes, and third-party libraries. With research, <b>I experimented with all different ways of organizing the data, from traditional filtering, faceted metadata, to search-as-filter.</b></p>
            
                <div class="project-img-div-long">
                    <img class="project-img-long" src="../assets/DARPA/initial-exploration.png" alt="Initial exploration">
                </div>
                <h4>Initial prototypes explored ways to efficiently filter and search for apps, permission, purposes, and third-party libraries.</h4>
                <br>  
            
            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <h3>LEARNING FROM USERS</h3>
            <h2>Users didn’t even know what to look, filter or search for</h2>
            <p>From testing my prototypes with users, I learned that <b>powerful functionality is useless unless users actually understand the subject matter (privacy) and have a clear mental model of the data structure</b>. 
            </p>
            <div class="project-img-div-med">
                    <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/DARPA/quotes-filter.png" alt="Users don't know what to look for">
            </div>
            <h4>Users were confused about the terms and the structure in initial iterations.</h4>
            <br>  
                
                
            <p>While these prototypes are powerful in finding apps with specific purposes and permissions (e.g. find the apps that use my location data for ads), people were not able to effectively it. <b>There's a lot more education work to do.</b></p>    
            <br>    
                
            <h2>People think they care about privacy, but in reality, no so much</h2>
            <p>Another interesting finding from user interviews and tests is that people don't care about privacy as much as they think. During the tests, they often lacked the motivation to actually delve into privacy settings and manage.</p>
            
            <div class="project-img-div-med">
                    <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/DARPA/quotes-care.png" alt="Users don't care that much">
            </div>
            <h4>Users don't actually care about privacy as much as they think.</h4>
            <br>  
            
            <p>This means:</p>
            <ul class="text-list">
                <li><b>We need to convince people to care more.</b><br> Users don't about their privacy as much as they think.</li>
                <li><b>We need to further simplify the configuration.</b></li>
                    <ul class="text-list">
                        <li>Minimize the number of clicks needed to set things up</li>
                        <li>Less text, more icons, easier to read with progressive disclosure</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><b>Install-time privacy setting UI is crucial. </b><br>It’s likely to be the only time that most users will review their privacy settings. (The install-time UI is still work-in-progress.)</li>
            </ul>
                
                
            <div class="space15px"></div>
                <h3>NEW PROBLEM + NEW SOLUTIONS</h3>
                <p>From research, the new problem emerged: <b>How can we make sure that people 1. understand the new data model, 2. become more engaged? </b> 
                    <br><br>After all, the ultimate goal is to help users best protect their mobile privacy. We want them to take actions and be active in their privacy protection. We can only expect behavioral change after emotional and cognitive change. </p>
                
                <br>
                <h2>Solution 1: Onboarding tutorial helped users learn about data privacy and build up the mental model</h2>
                <p><b>Action:</b> I created an onboarding tutorial to educate users of their data privacy, introducing the concept of permissions, purposes, and third-party libraries.<br> 
                <b>Result:</b> Users were able to have a much more clear mental model when they go into settings. </p>

                <div class="project-img-div-long">
                    <img class="project-img-long" src="../assets/DARPA/tutorials.png" alt="Onboarding tutorial">

                <h4>Onboarding tutorial explains permissions, purposes, and third-party libraries</h4>
                
                <br>
                <h2>Solution 2: A more exploratory design lead to less lost and more engaged users</h2>
                <p><b>Action:</b> Instead of just giving users category titles of privacy data, I decided to show more detailed examples of apps and types of privacy information upfront, to help users explore possibilities.<br> 
                <b>Result:</b> Users expressed fewer confusions, became more engaged, and showed more interest in managing their data privacy.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div><video class="project-vid-long" autoplay loop><source src="../assets/DARPA/exploratory-home.m4v" type="video/mp4"</video></div>
                <h4>Giving more detailed examples of privacy categories incentivises users to explore more.</h4>
                    
                
                <div class="space15px"></div>
                <h3>THE CHALLENGE CONTINTUES</h3>
                <p>While the last iteration solved the understanding and motivation problem, more problems surfaced through more user testing. 
                </p>
                    
                <ul class="text-list">
                    <li><b>The exploratory home screen layout is more engaging, but it also sacrificed some information architecture clarity.</b>   <ul><li>When user digged deep into each workflow, they found it somewhat confusing.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Some features might be repetitive as they are achieving the same goal.</b>
                        <ul><li>For example, system recommendations & turn off "ads" for all apps have the same goal: making bulk setting easier. But is the latter feature necessary? Having all these features seems to contribute the complexity problem. </li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Is the app offering too much flexibility?</b>
                        <ul><li>For example, the app now allows users to turn off any purpose for all apps. However, most purposes are benign and it's unlikely that users want to turn them off. Plus, this function would mostly be used power/expert users. Would a <i>IFTTT</i> or <i>Workflow</i> model work here?</li></ul>
                    </li>

            <h3>REFLECTIONS</h3>
            <h2>Always validate design assumptions with users</h2>
                <p>Designers and engineers often know “too much” to make good assumptions about the product or the user. Had I not test my early iterations with real users, I would not have changed my focus from how can I allow users to flexibly manage their data privacy, to how can I encourage them the care about data privacy and explore the possibilities.</p>
            
            <h2>Be proactive, be collaborative</h2>
                <p>As this is an independent study project, I was managing my own workflow and deadlines. I was proactive through the entire process, communicating with my team, collecting feedback, and getting the resources when needed. The help, insights, and co-creation I received from my advisor, the engineers I worked with, peer designers, and users were invaluable. All these brought me closer to achieving the initial project goals.</p>
