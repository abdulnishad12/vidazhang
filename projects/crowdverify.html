            <h3>PROBLEM SPACE</h3> 
            <h2>Use design to showcase the researcher's work, engage users, and build credibility</h2>
                <p>This is a passion project I worked on with a CMU Ph.D. student, Annabel Sun. Her research is about extracting the most important statements from Terms & Conditions so that consumers don't have to peruse 20 pages of policies and can focus on the most important ones. My role was to rebuild the website so that it best presents her work, builds credibility, and engages users <b>through rapid prototyping and testing</b>.
                </p>


            
            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <h3>DEFINING GOALS</h3>
                <p>Together with Annabel, we defined three main goals of the site:<br>
                    1. <b>Present</b> her research results about policies<br>
                    2. <b>Encourage</b> volunteers to help her research by comparing terms<br>
                    3. <b>Build a connection</b> with visitors so that they are more likely to revisit
                </p>
        
            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <h3>DESIGN PROCESS</h3>
            <h2>An iterative process focused on usability and effective communication</h2>
                <p>I focused on testing the usability of the site and how well the presented information communicates to visitors. It was an iterative process. With the three defined project goals in mind, we collected feedback from users, extracted insights, updated the design, and repeated.</p>

            <h3>DESIGN DECISIONS</h3>
            <h2>Direct user attention to what's important</h2>
                <p>As Herbert Simon famously said, "what information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients." Below are some major design decisions I made to direct users' attention:<br><br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Increase the legibility of "Sample Terms"</b><br><br>
                    In our studies, we found that users weren't willing to read through the long paragraphs of the "sample statements". I decided to reduce the number of sample terms to present, place information in <b>cards</b> to increase legibility (shorter text width), and <b>highlighted key sentences</b> to help users scan.<br></p>
                    <div class="project-img-div-med">
                        <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/CrowdVerify/hero.png" alt="CrowdVerify Hero">
                    </div>
                    <h4>Sample terms are shown in cards and key sentences are highlighted</h4>
                <br>
                    <br><p><b>Make "Contribute to Our Research" a call-to-action</b><br><br> 
                    This is an important call to action, but while testing the old design, some users didn't even notice it. It was neither taking enough real estate, nor drawing much attention. I added the call-to-action on the hero section and created a new section, not the homepage to allow visitors to compare terms without going to another page. This helps reduce churning.</p>
                    <div class="project-img-div-med">
                        <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/CrowdVerify/contribute.png" alt="CrowdVerify Contribute to Our Research">
                    </div>
                    <h4>Gave "Contribute to Our Research" a lot more real estate</h4>
                    <br>

                    <b><br><p>Simplify the list of analyzed companies</b><br><br> 
                    In our studies, we found that users actually won't read through the entire list. And there is no reason they need to. Simply showing some recognizable company icons will evoke interest to see more.</p>
                    <div class="project-img-div-med">
                        <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/CrowdVerify/list-of-companies.png" alt="CrowdVerify List of Companies">
                    </div>
                    <h4>Visualized list of companies with logos</h4>
        
            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <h3>BRAND IDENTITY</h3>
            <h2>An approachable visual system that builds trust</h2>
                <p>For a site that informs people about legal policies, establishing trustworthiness is crucial. At the same time, the visual style also needs to appear friendly and engaging. 
                </p>
                <p>Regarding color choices, I chose purple-blue-turquoise gradients. The blue create a professional identity, yet the unconventional hues added a modern/techy touch. The typeface, Open Sans, creates a credible and approachable aura.</p>
                <br>
            
                <div class="project-img-div-long">
                        <img class="project-img-long" src="../assets/CrowdVerify/Style-Guide.png" alt="CrowdVerify Style Guide">
                </div>
        
            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <h3>REFLECTIONS</h3>
            <p>I acted as a design consultant and worked directly with the owner of the research project. Since I only had about 10 days to design and deliver code, <b>project management and effective communication were crucial.</b> 
                </p>
            <p><b>Because of time constraint, we had to make compromises</b>: sometimes it means changing the design to make it easier to code and sometimes it means postponing certain functions due to technical difficulties. The website is not perfect. For example, the search bar doesn't yet show the text "no results found" when the situation occurs. The interaction of the individual company pages is not optimal. With limited time and resource, <b>prioritization is necessary to ensure the timely delivery of the product.</b> </p>
